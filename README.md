To contribute a plugin please do the following:

1. Name your plugin using a Java-style reverse-domain-name
   name like "com.example.myplugin". This ensures that plugin

   may use "org.dita-community." as the first part of the
   name.

2. Include a README.TXT or README.md or similar documentation in the top-level
   directory of your plugin that provides at least the following
   information:
   
   - The purpose of the plugin (what it does)
   - Contact information: who owns it? Who developed and maintains it?
   - Usage details: transformation type name (if it's a transformation
     type), parameters, etc.
   - Open Toolkit versions the plugin works with
   
3. One your plugin has been added to the repository, create
   a Wiki page for your plugin.

A. Create an Issue in the dita-ot-plugins repository and attach your plugin to it. 
   One of the DITA Community team members will add your plugin to the repository.

      development machine.
